# ME 352 Labs Jupyter Book

This is a small sample book to test Jupyter books to collect ME 352 Lessons and Labs.
The Lessons sections contain notebooks from the class meetings and thus may appear incomplete as they would have been accompanied by work that appeared on the board, other documents, slides, etc. Other times we have used the notebooks to 'explore' so, for example, tasks asking for linear regressions may show nonlinear regressions. Other notebooks contain intentional errors so we can practice debugging and consulting documentation. The lessons give the reader an idea of the topics covered that lesson, but they are not intended to be an accurate and complete description of the class.

Some of the questions and data sets come from Numerical Analysis by Burden and Faires. Others come from [Quantitative Reasoning and the Environment](https://sites.google.com/view/qre) by Langkamp and Hull and the [NIST Engineering Statistics Handbook](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/index.htm).

More work needs to be done with citations, cleaning up images, and cleaning up LaTeX formatting in the notebooks.
